Dies Irae

It's that daily routine, but ya'll knew that
Step up in the building asking "who dat?"
I'm doing no stats, I mean that new rap
It don't matter what you doin' 'cause we do laps
That's new facts
Okay calm down if you scared
You ain't calm I don't care
You can run around get the gunna down
We blow it up in that air
Bomb bombs right there
On top of all of these stairs
Ya'll down below, ya'll soundin' low
Keep lookin' up and just stare to see
This ain't no hide a seek, find your seat
See we came to take names, ya'll remindin' me
Ya'll can't lie to me, too much pride top be
Just unleash another beast, that's just a side of me
Keep mindin' me like look now, like look now
That left biscuit hook now
My bucks down, you shook now
Got mo' heat, get cooked now
Like oh man, I know that
Front stage, I show down
Just another animal that's steppin' out
'Cause I'ma beast. Where you at?
Oh my god, uh, uh

There we go. Whatchu doin'?
Oh my god, where at? Whatchu doin'?

Nah for real. That's a beast
Ya'll just know that that's a beast
Been unleashed 'cause I'ma beast

When I step up on the scene that's a beast
Okay calm down if you scared

Bomb bombs right there
On top of all of these stairs

Keep lookin' up and just stare to see
